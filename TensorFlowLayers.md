1. Flatten(input_shape = ):

Make a 2d array into a 1d array.

2. Dense(output_nodes, activation=):

Linear + non-linear transformation

Linear: input # of notes -> output_notes (m to n)

non linear: n to n.

3. bottleneck layer:

A layer that contains less notes compared with its previous layer. In contrast 

4. Fully connected layer

Every neuron in one layer is connecting to every neuron to another layer.
